			<h2>What is a Multiple Star System?</h2>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>A multiple star system is a group of three or more stars that are gravitationally bound and orbit
					around a common center of mass (the barycenter). The most common type of multiple star system is a
					binary star system, but there are many systems with three or more stars.</p>

			</section>
			<h3 class="dim-text">How Are They Possible?</h3>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>Multiple star systems are possible due to the balance of gravitational forces between the stars.
					While their orbits can be stable over long periods, they are often complex rather than perfectly
					precise. Small perturbations can influence their trajectories, especially in systems with three or
					more stars, potentially leading to significant changes or even the ejection of one of the stars in
					certain cases.</p>

			<h2>Trinary Star Systems</h2>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>A trinary star system, or triple star system, consists of three stars gravitationally bound to each
					other. These systems often consist of two stars orbiting closely as a binary, with the third star
					orbiting the binary at a greater distance.</p>
				<br>

			<h3 class="dim-text">The Alpha Centauri System</h3>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>The <strong>Alpha Centauri</strong> system is the closest stellar system to Earth. It consists of
					three stars: <strong>Alpha
						Centauri A</strong>, <strong>Alpha Centauri B</strong> (which form a close binary pair), and
					<strong>Proxima Centauri</strong>, which orbits
					the
					pair at a much greater distance. Proxima is the closest individual star to our solar system.</p>
			</section>
			<h3 class="dim-text">The HD 131399 Star System</h3>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>The <strong>HD 131399</strong> system is a trinary star system located about 320 light-years away in
					the constellation
					Centaurus. It features a unique configuration with one of its stars, <strong>HD 131399A</strong>,
					being orbited by
					two
					other stars, <strong>HD 131399B</strong> and <strong>HD 131399C</strong>, in a wide orbit. This
					system gained attention due to the
					discovery of a giant planet, <strong>HD 131399Ab</strong>, which orbits one of the stars in this
					complex arrangement.

			<h2>Quaternary Star Systems</h2>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>A quaternary star system consists of four stars that are gravitationally bound and orbit around a
					common center of mass. These systems are typically arranged hierarchically, with two pairs of stars
					orbiting each other in a stable configuration.</p>
				<br>

			<h3 class="dim-text">The PH1 Star System</h3>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>The <strong>PH1 system</strong>, also known as <strong>Kepler-64</strong>, is a quaternary star
					system that contains a circumbinary
					planet (a planet that orbits two stars). The two central stars are orbited by another pair of stars
					at a farther distance. This system is notable for being one of the few where a planet has been found
					in a quaternary system.</p>
			</section>
			<h3 class="dim-text">The KOI-2626 Star System</h3>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>The <strong>KOI-2626</strong> system is another quaternary system where a planet has been detected.
					It is a complex
					system with four stars interacting in a way that results in an unusual orbital configuration, and it
					demonstrates the possibility of planetary formation in systems with more than two stars.</p>

			<h2>Quinary Star Systems</h2>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>A quinary star system consists of five stars bound together. These systems are very rare and tend to
					be arranged hierarchically to maintain stability.</p>

			<h3 class="dim-text">1SWASP Star System</h3>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>The <strong>1SWASP</strong> system is a quintuple star system that gained attention due to its
					unusual configuration,
					where five stars are organized in a stable arrangement of close binaries and a more distant
					companion.
					Such systems are quite rare, and this one provided insights into the dynamics of quinary star
					systems.</p>
			</section>
			<h3 class="dim-text">Other?</h3>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>Other quinary systems are extremely rare and often have unique configurations that are difficult to
					study due to their complex gravitational interactions. Research into these systems helps expand our
					understanding of how multiple star systems form and evolve over time.</p>
			</section>

		<section class="related-sections">
			<h2>Are There Systems With More Than 5 Stars?</h2>
			<section class="padding-16 bordered-text-light">
				<p>Yes, systems with more than five stars do exist, but they are exceedingly rare. These systems,
					known as <strong>senary</strong> (6) or even higher-order star systems, involve intricate
					hierarchies of binaries
					or trinaries orbiting a common center of mass. A well-known example is <strong>Castor</strong>, a
					senary star
					system in which six stars are grouped into three binary pairs. Systems with more than five stars
					are fascinating because their gravitational dynamics are much more complex, and studying them
					provides unique insights into the behavior of stars in extreme environments.</p>
